                <p>I'm a university student and still have 3 years till graduation. I can choose to spend the remaining years on entertainment, or I can choose to learn more while I still have time.</p>

                <h2 class="blue">What I learn</h2>
                <p>Some say learning is hard and boring. I blame the education system for that. Learning for own interests is much more fun than most people expect. For now, I'm quite interested in these fields:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web Development</li>
                    <li>Penetration Testing</li>
                    <li>Competitive Programming</li>
                    <li>Design</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here're some projects that helped me learn a lot.</p>

                    <h3>Programming League</h3>
                    <p>Programming League is a competition organized by students for students. Joining the closed catogery, I've the chance to earn a lot of experience and acquiring my first taste of victory.</p>

                    <h3>System Programming Competition</h3>
                    <p>Joined this competition to kind of peek into operation system programming. It's an eye-opening opportunity and definitely learned a lot from it. Planned to learn more about this field in the future.</p>

                    <h3>Web Dev Team</h3>
                    <p>A team consisting of about 10 people, who wanted to try and venture into the branch of Web Development, a demanding field in this era. Led by an aspiring leader, this project will definitely allow us to learn a bunch of new things, and at the same time know more about each other.</p>
